                    <p class="occupy-grid-2 description">In this action, platformer, local co-op game, the two players control robot bodyguards who are trying to protect their individual AI VIP robots. The objective of this game is to eliminate the other player's VIP robot while protecting their own.<br>This game is made using our own custom 2D game engine that we built from scratch. I implemented the sprite sheet splicing system for the engine.<br>Using the AStar pathfinding algorithm, the VIP robots find their way around the map. The challenge this time is the height element where they need to determine spots that are jumpable.

You are trapped in a disco theme building guarded by robots. Solve the puzzles and fight your way to freedom.<br>This game is made using the school DigiPen's custom-made engine.<br>In this project, I was tasked to code the behaviour of the robots roaming around the game. The robots move around using the AStar pathfinding algorithm that I learnt.

You can deploy turrets and defenses to fight off the aliens in this game.<br>This game is inspired by the game, Plants vs Zombies.

Also, I programmed the behaviour of the aliens who are moving towards the spaceship.
